      Number using O6 output only:             179
      Number using O5 output only:              97
      Number using O5 and O6:                   29
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     14
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:        14
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   115 out of   2,278    5%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       160 out of   4,556    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          327
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           144 out of     327   44%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   8 out of     327    2%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         175 out of     327   53%
    Number of unique control sets:              13
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              53 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
